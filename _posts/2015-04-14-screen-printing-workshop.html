<blockquote>“In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn.” ― Phil Collins</p></blockquote>
<h2>We  Print</h2>
<p align="left">We are known by the name “Jama - Handprint Art. we are proud to be known as screen printers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_printing">Screen printing </a>is our passion, and inherited profession in family. it's what we do. we still make our own stencils on screens and run ink through the stencils</p>
<p align="left">In this digital era where everything is at a touch of the finger tips, but still there are various such areas where this medium is still going steady and many opportunities for those startups who wish to build their own brands and builds own product line of quirky and kitsch lifestyle products or simply who wish to have their own screen print studio for customize printing services.</p>
<h2 align="left"><span style="font-size: x-large;">We Teach</span></h2>
<p align="left">These ancient technique is soon dying because of its laborious process and less income, that’s where the idea of teaching screen printing germinated.</p>
<p align="left">We have been practicing this art since 1968, plunged into teaching this art since 2009. We used to conduct this workshop at our very own commercial unit in sion dharavi. But this year from 2015 we have started going places.</p>
<p align="left">We really want to thank the team of Makers Asylum, for giving this opportunity to conduct the workshop and helping us with the space. Especially Vaibhav Chhabra and Akshat who responded to me with a prompt “YES” about my screen print workshop. Also a warm invitation to their interesting hub Maker’s Asylum which could help many like me and others who believe in doing rather than mere watching or with ready made stuff. As my screen printing workshop goals matched with similar line what (makers asylum) they are doing, its only the areas are different.</p>
<p align="left">The goal of our workshop is very simple</p>
<p align="left">• Keep this dying art alive</p>
<p align="left">• For those who want to build their own brands by learning this technique. Which can be easily replicated at home, easy to use material and mobile equipments easy on pocket for startups, not restricting the space.</p>
<p align="left">• Whether you’re a hobbyists, Graphic Designer , Corporate or small scale industry manufacture like PCBs, T-shirt, Invites, Wedding Cards, or a Customize gift solution company.</p>
<p align="left">And to my surprises we had participants from different field, such as copywriter, architect, software developer, an engineer, graphic designer, digital designer and an entrepreneur - already into the business of t-shirt manufacturing, all enthusiasts to learn the art and use it in their specialization areas.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4479 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2-700x525.jpg" alt="Screen Printing Session in Progress" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<p align="left">The session begin with introduction (nothing new but it’s a ritual and best to know and network).</p>
<p align="left">Well that’s how I got to know that they all came from different field, I indeed had a great time with bundle of different questions and more and more to share with the known and unknowns in screen print as a medium.</p>
<p align="left">And now it began with real serious introduction to educate with the basic material of screen printing, basic items such as</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4480 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3-700x525.jpg" alt="3" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<h3 align="left">Step 1. Introduction to Materials</h3>
<p align="left">A ) What should be size of the Frame ?</p>
<p align="left">B ) How to calculate the size of the screen (the usable area for creating the stencil )?</p>
<p align="left">C ) Depending on the artwork and the substrate to be printed one should consider the suitable mesh count of the screens, like 140, 120, 80, 100, 40 etc ?</p>
<p align="left">D ) Emulsion and Sensitizer ? Type and preparation</p>
<p align="left">E) Inks</p>
<p align="left">F) Printing Table</p>
<p align="left">                <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4481" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/4-300x225.jpg" alt="4" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/5.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-4486 alignnone" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/5-300x225.jpg" alt="5" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/6.jpg"><img class=" size-large wp-image-4487 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6-700x477.jpg" alt="6" width="700" height="477" /></a></p>
<h3 align="left">Step 2. Coat Screen - Apply the Emulsion</h3>
<p align="left">The participants were asked to apply emulsion (green solution + sensitizer) on the given ready screens. An instructor to guide on how to apply and hold the coater!! One can use any Hard plastic card or even a very good visiting card would work or squeeze if you are comfortable with even application. The pros and cons of applying and coating the emulsion discussed and learnt, hand on experience.</p>
<p align="left">                <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/7.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4482 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7-300x225.jpg" alt="7" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/8.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4483 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/8-300x225.jpg" alt="8" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<h3 align="left">Step 3. Design / Artwork to Print</h3>
<p align="left">Everyone got busy in creating their own designs.</p>
<p align="left">                <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/10.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4484 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/10-300x225.jpg" alt="10" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/9.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4488 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/9-300x225.jpg" alt="9" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<h3 align="left">Step 5. Transfer the Design – Build your own stencil</h3>
<p align="left">Now the result - whether all our steps have been on right track since it’s a manual process, even an extra minute would create loads of difference, ensure that its should not be overexposed or underexposed. How to build your own exposure unit at home. Being a very bright day and lots of light from al the sides spoiled the mood as we could not transfer some designs initially but we could correct it since we had some good ready stencils with us to further proceed for the final stage.</p>
<p align="left">Lesson Learnt : we need a dark room to expose the screens.</p>
<p align="left">                 <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/11.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4485 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/11-300x225.jpg" alt="11" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/12.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4489 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/12-300x225.jpg" alt="12" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<h3 align="left">Step 6. Set the Table – Ready to Print</h3>
<p align="left">We had seven tables of different designs to print. Check the pics below:</p>
<p align="left">                 <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/20.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4497 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20-300x225.jpg" alt="20" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/19.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4496 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/19-300x225.jpg" alt="19" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p align="left">                 <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/18.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4495 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/18-300x225.jpg" alt="18" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/17.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4494 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/17-300x225.jpg" alt="17" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p align="left">                 <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/16.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4493 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/16-300x225.jpg" alt="16" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/15.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4492 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/15-300x225.jpg" alt="15" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p align="left">                 <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/14.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4491 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/14-300x225.jpg" alt="14" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://128.199.171.193/app/uploads/2015/04/13.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4490" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/13-300x225.jpg" alt="13" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p align="left">You guys can see the results on paper and t-shirt and smile on the participants face. Nothing compares to the satisfaction one sees when its done with your own hands and turns out to be successful.<br />
Looking forward for them to try it once to replicate this at home. I am just at a call away if you get stuck or any error to be corrected while practicing this art.<br />
As its said “PRACTICE MAKES MAN PERFECT”</p>
