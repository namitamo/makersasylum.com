<p>This will be a quick progress report. Saturday 13th March, I got to the asylum quite early and began putting in the final panels of the MAME cabinet buildgroup.<br />
There wasn't any good board around for the back panel and also to avoid putting in more screws, I decided to use the cross I had made the Saturday before and like a window, put in 4 panels.</p>
<p>Cutting a rabbet into each length wasn't much of a challenge for the rabbet cutting machine and we must have done in 30 minutes what I take a day to do by hand.<br />
That done, I quickly cut out the remaining pieces and glued them on to the frame leaving only the back attached with screws.<br />
I cut out sloping pieces to support the console area, as this will take the most punishment. You know how one forgets where they are when playing games, right?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The front panel will remain open for now. Rupin will solder the switches, add a few more I believe and then install the pi.<br />
That's it for this report.</p>
<p>Oh and the cabinet needs a coat of primer and then paint.</p>
