<p dir="ltr">One of the craziest weeks at the Asylum. It was loaded with action. If you weren't there, then you simply weren't there. So let me tell you what we've been upto. To start with, we spent a great afternoon hosting the members of Social Innovation Exchange Summer School 2015 at the Asylum. We got to tell them about how our open makerspace grew from Eyenetra's office with handful of people to our current massive space with one of the largest maker communities in the country and that it's been making a phenomenal social impact. They were fascinated to learn all of it. So fascinated that they got into some serious artistic action by grabbing spray cans and colouring our white walls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Undergrad students of Industrial Design Center, IIT Bombay paid a visit to the Asylum. They were completely blown away to learn about the existence of such a makerspace. It was fun watching them go "Whoa! This is awesome" as we introduced them to our facility.</p>
