<p>After a long long day, I've woken up at 5, nervous I guess, I sit to type out my joy.<br />
And what a joy the day has brought me. If you're regular on the group then you'll know that I'm taking a carpentry class, or is it giving a class on carpentry.</p>
<p>Initially when I called the class I didn't think I would get anyone as zany as I. Who in their right mind would want to learn carpentry, when there are easier things like electronics, or more exciting things like knitting?<br />
Well there are lots of people out there, some cooler than me, but most just like me. I met 8 of them today. Their reasons for wanting to learn wood working are the same as mine.</p>
<p>They came to the Asylum promptly at 10, some a little later (Yes Mrinal, I'm pointing at you) and listened to me talk about one of my passions over the last 7 years.<br />
I led them through</p>
<ol>
<li>The concepts of wood working, and in a broader sense the concepts of working with any material.</li>
<li>Then onto grain and how it determines strength.</li>
<li>Wood working tools, we discussed a whole range of them, and how to use them</li>
</ol>
<p>Hands on quickly followed and the plan was to make 4 mallets which we could use in the coming sessions.<br />
With the limited time we had on the first day, I decided to simply cut up the pieces and then continue in the next class.</p>

<p>By 1:30 we were all done and hungry as we were, there was a fairly large amount of joy when someone from the asylum told us we could continue to 4:30.</p>
<p>A quick lunch later and we were back at the workbench.</p>
<p>They quickly got a hang of how to measure, mark out and cut lengths of wood and 8 "cheeks" were quickly cut up. Followed by the handles.</p>
<p>Handles were marked onto the cheeks and each participant cut out a slot for the handle by sawing on the line down to the marked depth and then chiseling out the waste.<br />
We then glued up the mallet by sandwiching the handle between the cheeks.</p>
<p>I was amazed to see that the fit of most mallets was so perfect, that we had to use the clamps to bring the cheeks together.</p>
<p>So here we are 6 hours from the start of the day and 4 mallets richer. But most importantly we have learned the basics which we will need to repeat a number of times while making the laptop table.</p>

<p>Next session will be understanding drawing, measurements, laying out of the joints and cutting out the joints.<br />
I believe very strongly that the raw laptop table will be done by the end of the second day.</p>
