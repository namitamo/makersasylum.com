<p><strong>Maker´s Asylum  is officially a Fab Lab!</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-5506 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/HIGHRES-300x110.jpg" alt="Maker´s Asylum is officially Fablab" width="300" height="110" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when Maker´s Asylum officially became a Fab Lab,  We couldn’t wait to share the news with our community of makers. What exactly is a Fab Lab, and why are we so happy about being one? Well, from the official website of fab foundation [http://www.fabfoundation.org/ ] -</p>
<p>¨Fab Lab is the educational outreach component of MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), an extension of its research into digital fabrication and computation. A Fab Lab is a technical prototyping platform for innovation and invention, providing stimulus for local entrepreneurship. A Fab Lab is also a platform for learning and innovation: a place to play, to create, to learn, to mentor, to invent. To be a Fab Lab means connecting to a global community of learners, educators, technologists, researchers, makers and innovators- -a knowledge sharing network that spans 30 countries and 24 time zones. Because all Fab Labs share common tools and processes, the program is building a global network, a distributed laboratory for research and invention.¨</p>
<p>Being recognised as a Fab Lab connects us to a global community of people just like us to interact with, learn from and share our ideas and knowledge. The projects we work on now have a global window to reach out to a larger audience. Anyone associated with the Fab Lab network will now be able to see Maker’s Asylum listed amongst the Fab Labs across the world on their website.</p>
<p>Also, there are interesting projects listed on Fab Foundation that are open source, which we can access and build on at the Asylum. More importantly, we will now access to sponsorships, such as softwares like Solid Works, which are only available for registered Fab Labs . We also have access to Fab Exchange, which lists opportunities for Job Exchange, Knowledge Exchange, Fab Share, Fab Markets , Fab Economy and Fab Connect which the Fab foundation is developing on their website.</p>
<p>Associating with one of the first maker spaces, conceptualised and developed successfully at MIT ´s Centre for Bits and Atoms, is exciting in our journey of building a collaborative space and community in the country.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning of further collaborations with people and communities, to push forward Maker’s Asylum’s agenda of providing access and enabling people in making their ideas happen.</p>
