<p>The final session of the first carpentry class began today like most other Saturdays. I was in early and made my rounds of ISDI. I then sharpened the blades and put out all the tools that we would need. You can read about the earlier sessions here<br />

<p>Today would be a low tool usage day. I had planned to simply get the glue up done and the tops cut up and stuck to the top.</p>

<p>Ofcourse, I knew I was dreaming. Only one participant, Mihir was anywhere close to completing the frames for the table. But the others were not far behind, and I felt 99% confident that we would have the laptop tables completed for the carpentry course after all my fav gang knew everything they needed to know; now it was a question of practice. I was vaguely nervous. ;)</p>
<p>We put the table out and sort of simply got into it. By 11 the final slots were cut, last minute lengthening and shortening of legs and supports was done and we were ready for the hinge. The hinge I had chosen was a nut bolt with a nice semi circular head; very classy. I got out the drill and began the hunt for the chuck key. If you've ever used a drill you'll know its terribly impossible to get things done without a chuck key, but there was none.</p>
<p>Vaibhav came out and showed us a "jugad" how to tighten a chuck, using just the power of the human hand and some care, and some insanity. I wouldn't recommend it tends to wear out the drill motor. But hey, desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>

<p>After lunch we completed the drilling of the hole to receive the nut bolt. Now it maybe a little difficult to explain, but the hole lies at the center of the largest circle that can be drawn within the leg. The leg has also to be rounded out along the same circle so that it can rotate around the bolt. maybe I could come up with an illustration sometime.</p>

<p>Once that was done, we began glue up. Along with the glue up, I explained fasteners: metal screws, wood screws, dowels and nails. All of which i hate but a carpentry class would be incomplete without the theory.</p>
<p>Another thing that is dear to my heart is wood working at home and how it can be done. I have been doing it for the last 7 years, so I believe that everyone can, if they are passionate enough. But enough philosophy. Glue up takes exactly the time that I take to speak, and now we had the first glimpse of the final product. Mihir was done. He was standing, admiring his table with the look of a new dad.</p>
<p>Not far away, I was looked on like a new grandfather. Happy. Pleased. Proud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest were not far behind, each one completed with a little pushing and shoving and the top sheet was engraved with their names. Mihir the first completer, got the Dunning Kruger effect on his. Ain't Â it cool.</p>

<p>One last shot with all of us who were left, hugs and kisses and they were gone.</p>

<p>My children left the nest. They are prepared to woodwork, they don't need me anymore; I believe it. I pray they do.</p>
