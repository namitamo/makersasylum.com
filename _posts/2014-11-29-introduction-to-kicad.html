<p>A talk I presented at Electronics Rocks 2012, Bangalore</p>
<p>I have been using KiCad since I first started off in to Open Hardware around 2009. Around that time, KiCad was still pretty basic but it still seemed like the best EDA tool. Since then, it has come a long way, especially after the support and development push from CERN, the European super-collider folks. All of the hardware projects I have done since then have been done in KiCad.</p>
<p>Here is a video of a talk I presented at the Electronics Rocks 2012 conference in Bangalore. (Note : Pardon the squeaky vioce, I had a bad throat day). It's about 40 minutes, during which time I am able to just about scratch the surface. A deeper orientation would require about 2~3 days at the least. Some of the stuff is a bit dated now, since KiCad has improved by leaps and bounds since 2012. But the basics still hold good.</p>
