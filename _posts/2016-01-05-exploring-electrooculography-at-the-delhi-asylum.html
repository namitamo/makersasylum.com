<p>One of the most exciting ideas that’s been explored at the Delhi Asylum recently has got to be Shruti &amp; Naman’s electrooculography project.</p>

<p>Electrooculography is a a fantastic concept that the two stumbled upon during their winter training at college. It inspired them to whip up a quick model to test it out.</p>

<p>The way it works, is by placing pairs of electrodes around the eyes, it becomes possible to measure the subtlest of eye movements.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5236" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5241-300x200.jpg" alt="IMG_5241" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>If the eye moves from the centre to either of the two electrodes, the electrodes can ‘see’ the positive and negative sides of the retina. This causes a potential difference between the electrodes. Assuming the resting potential stays constant, the recorded potential is a measure of the eye’s position.</p>

<p>As a proof of concept, they chose to control a robotic arm using the EOG circuit. The plan however is to scale the project up and implement it on a wheelchair. It could be of tremendous use to paralysed patients.</p>

<p>In addition, they also plan to introduce components into the setup that would allow for 3D mapping of the area, letting the wheelchair sense whether it’s advisable to move forward or not.</p>

<p>Given the potential of this project, we can’t wait to see Shruti &amp; Naman explore this idea further and hopefully implement their wheelchair prototype soon!</p>
