<p>This week I organise the asylum. How did I get into this? Well I've had a day's break between carpentry classes, of course when i say a day it means a Saturday; the previous class got over on the 16th; the next begins on the 30th. Somehow in that one single lonesome day, I have managed to get myself embroiled in an activity that is closest to my heart and one that also gives me the heebi jeebies.</p>
<p>I have volunteered to organise the asylum.</p>
<p>There I've said it, it's out there. Now I can't renegade. In my defense, I was bored with spending a day painting the MAME cabinet.</p>
<p>Me and my trusty spaceman Karthik are going to re-organise and re-furbish the entire asylum; one tiny bit at a time.<br />
We start with breaking up the asylum in sections.<br />
1. Carpentry and Mechanical<br />
2. Electronics<br />
3. Oragami<br />
4. Painting<br />
5. Laser Cutter<br />
6. 3D Printing<br />
7. TT table</p>
<p>Oh wait. The TT table isnt ours. I got a wee bit carried away.</p>
<p>So first up organise the carpentry and Mechanical section. The 2 of us have spent a lot of time thinking about what would look cooler, yet be functional and extensible. We hit on this.</p>

<p>We designed this.</p>
<p>Now this design will require 1 sheet of 1/4 inch ply and 2 sheets of 1/2 inch ply and I'm not completely sure that it won't keel over. But hey isn't that what the asylum is all about; Push the boundary of the impossible, the unimaginable and conquer our fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>This week, that shelf is our plan.</p>
<p>We move all the power tools over to this cutie; open up space on the existing shelves for some more possibilities sic junk.</p>
<p>We then move onto electronics next week.</p>
<p>This will be a series of build groups and I invite people to come help with what ever you can; even if it is simply figuring out what is the best configuration for hanging the tools on the peg board.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, we do need some sponsorship for the wood and the screws.</p>
