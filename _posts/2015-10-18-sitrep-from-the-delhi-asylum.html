<p>It’s been a busy couple of weeks at the Delhi Asylum. Between a ton of exciting projects being worked on and planning some fun stuff we’ll announce soon, it’s kept us busy enough to have not updated our status in a while. Well, consider this a sitrep.</p>
<p><strong>Spreading the love for Making</strong><br />
We had a fun day recently when a group of students from Ashoka University dropped by the Asylum.</p>

<p>Most of them never having experienced a makerspace before, understandably had a ton of questions. We did our best answering them all, while teaching them a thing or two about 3D printing and laser cutting.</p>

<p><strong>Builds and Experiments</strong><br />
It’s been a design heavy couple of weeks at the Asylum, as we’ve had a group of Accessory &amp; Product Design students working at the Asylum on their projects.</p>

<p>Kartik has been exploring solutions as to how best to present his portfolio, being a final year student and all that.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ananya worked on a prototype for her furniture design project.</p>

<p>Niharika simultaneously was working on refining a prototype of her bathroom fixtures project.</p>

<p>I must say, she did a splendid job of it too.</p>

<p>Ananya even managed to make a little something for her father as a gift.</p>

<p>Ofcourse being surrounded by product designers, we all got entrenched in experimenting with the laser cutter. I’m honestly still in awe of that machine.</p>
<p>[embed]https://www.facebook.com/makersasylumdelhi/photos/a.101989746814052.1073741828.101621430184217/164502577229435/?type=3&theater[/embed]</p>
<p>Fine, I confess. I can’t get enough of that machine.</p>
<p>[embed]https://www.facebook.com/makersasylumdelhi/photos/a.101989746814052.1073741828.101621430184217/162966460716380/?type=3&theater[/embed]</p>
<p>Ofcourse, we’re never satisfied till we make use of all the tools at our disposal.</p>
<p>Ashish has been working on some fun electronics projects. He’s currently working on this great lighting concept that we’re all quite excited about. Stay tuned while he wraps that up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, while the members do their thing, the team has been hard at work collaborating with our friends at Funstore in planning for a comprehensive IoT course that we plan on rolling out soon.</p>

<p>Needless to say, we figured out a way to incorporate the laser into the course. Because, why not?</p>

<p><strong>Making New Friends</strong></p>
<p>Oh but that’s not all. We also made some new friends this week. <a href="http://khojworkshop.org">KHOJ International Artists’ Association</a>, which as it happens, is situated right next to us, happened to have their end of <a href="http://khojworkshop.org/program_cat/international-residencies/">residency</a> show this week. A bunch of resident artists at KHOJ, stopped by the Asylum to use everything from the 3D printers to the laser, in getting their work done for the show.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Paul, dropped by the Asylum and inspired by the laser (yes I know, the laser’s a real winner), decided to design a case for his Kindle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s only the highlights of what we’ve been upto in the last two weeks or so. This week is going to be <strong>even more fun</strong> as we have a couple of awesome things planned. Stay tuned as we announce those.</p>
<p>Till next time .. <strong>keep making!</strong></p>
