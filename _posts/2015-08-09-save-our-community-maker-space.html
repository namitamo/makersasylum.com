<p>We have till August 31st to vacate our current space…</p>
<p>The team at Maker’s Asylum is currently faced with a challenge; we’re losing our maker space in Mumbai and the hunt is on for funds to rent out a new location. But we aren’t worried.</p>
<p>When Maker’s Asylum started in 2013, it was only possible because the community came out to show their enthusiastic support. They joined in to build tables, donate tools and volunteer their time. It would not have been possible without your help.</p>
<p>We are certain that this time as well, we will be able to raise the funds necessary to acquire a new home for our Maker community with your support.</p>
<p><em>Currently, we are a community of 140 members with 500 footfalls from curious minds every month and 6,000 social media supporters.</em></p>
<p>The good part is that we’ve ignited the Maker Movement in India. The bad part — we’ve lost the space we’ve called home for the last six months. The design school that let us use a portion of their cafeteria for our activities needs us to vacate.</p>
<p>In order to continue feeding the hungry community of Makers, we need to find a new space to rent, and soon!</p>
<p>For our community, the risk of losing the space means projects being abandoned midway, practical learning being put on hold and tinkers left without the access to tools that make their ideas grow.</p>
<p><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></p>
<p>We’re raising funds to rent out a new space that will support the strength of the community. The funds will help us pay off debts incurred after purchasing the tools. Without your help, we risk losing the space and rendering our growing family of makers homeless.</p>
<p>You can help us MAKE this happen.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Come teach a class at our new space</li>
<li>Help spread the word</li>
<li>Donate tools for the new space</li>
<li>Or join us in Building our new space!</li>
</ul>
