<p style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="en-IN">Some time in July, I got in touch with the team at <a class="western" href="http://www.makerthemovie.com/">www.makerthemovie.com</a> asking them if we can hold an official screening of their superlative documentary about the maker movement. At the Makers Asylum, we are passionate about pushing the maker movement in India, and we thought it would be perfect to have a screening of the movie to expose people here toÂ what is ha</span><span lang="en-IN">p</span><span lang="en-IN">pening around the world. </span><span lang="en-IN">Once the MAKER team responded positively, I discussed it with the rest of the gang at Makers Asylum, and we decided to host a screening. Hosting a public screening was going to cost us USD295/- which would have to come from our pockets or from donors/sponsors. I replied back to MAKER </span><span lang="en-IN">team </span><span lang="en-IN">telling them :</span></p>
<blockquote><p>So, the plan now "looks" simple :</p>
<p>1. Look for a Sponsor or Sponsors<br />
2. Look for a Venue<br />
3. Screen the Movie</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, turns out it wasn't as simple as it sounded. We couldn't find any sponsors (or maybe we didn't look hard enough), although we spread word out through friends and social media. The venue, on the other hand, turned out to be a nice surprise when our friend Rajeev at Studio-X (<a class="western" href="http://www.arch.columbia.edu/studio-x-global/locations/studio-x-mumbai">http://www.arch.columbia.edu/studio-x-global/locations/studio-x-mumbai</a>) agreed to let us have their space for nothing. We had already partnered with Studio-X during an earlier Nokia event for Urban Innovation (http://youtu.be/ODvacd5NSb8) , so we knew the palce was a perfect setting. Still no sponsors, and we couldn't wait much longer to purchase the screening rights. Luckily, the team at MAKER the movie realized our quandary and offered us a generous discount on the screening cost, which helped us a lot. Eventually, the cost for the whole event was paid out of our own resources, with no external support.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-602" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/movie-2-1.jpg" alt="Make Day Poster" width="700" height="388" /></p>
<p>Through all of August, we got down to planning the event, which we had now designated as âMake Day Mumbaiâ to be held on September 20<sup>th</sup>, where we wanted to feature a whole after noon of hands-on making, followed by screening the movie in the evening. The plan was to have sessions on Origami, PVC Pipe Lamp Making, 3D Printing and other fun stuff during the afternoon. We interspersed the making sessions with some inspirational talks by some maker friends such as Shreekant Pawar from <a class="western" href="http://www.diabe.to/">www.diabe.to</a> who talked about why his company choose to make their product Open Source, <a title="Angad Daryani" href="http://www.angadmakes.com/" target="_blank">Angad Daryani</a> , a young 15 year old kid who talked about his experience as a Maker, Shailesh Prabhu from <a href="http://www.yellowmonkeystudios.com/" target="_blank">Yellow Monkey Studios</a> who talked about âSteam Punk Artâ and myself where I talked about the DiY and Maker Movement.</p>
<p>On D-day, the whole of the Maker's Asylum team was at the venue from early in the morning, setting things up. We had three 3D printers, a Polargraph draw bot, besides all of the hand's on making tables that were set up. T-Shirts arrived in the nick of time on 20<sup>th</sup> Sept morning. Banners and posters were done, we hung up tools on the walls,and generally turned Studio-X in to one big maker space for the day. The team had just a short bit of time to grab some Pizza lunch before the first visitors started trickling in.</p>
<p>For Make Day, I had dug up the g-code for my Ultimaker that allowed it to 3D print objects in continuous âauto-printâ mode â once a object is printed, the print head is used to push the object out of the print bed, and the next print starts. Samarth, our 3D printing expert, set up and tuned the Ultimaker, and it started the auto-print routine at around 11:00 in the morning (or probably earlier). By the end of the day, it had been running continuously (about 8 hours) pushing out Stretchy Bracelets every 15 minutes. I also set up my âPolargrapâ draw bot. It uses a pen attached to two strings that are driven by stepper motors, and is an example of how a machine can be used to create âArtâ.</p>
<p>I had some trouble setting it up, and never managed to grab enough time to set it up correctly.</p>
<p>For me, the day passed off in a breeze. I was busy talking to people continuously, about the Maker movement, my open hardware projects, talking to students discussing stuff and so on, and before I know it, Vaibhav came up to me and said it's time to start the screening. Whoa, already ? I glanced at the time, and couldn't believe when I read 5:30pm. I guess we had between 70 to 100 people attend Make Day and hopefully they all went back motivated to do some DIY.</p>
<p>My Maker friend Sohil Patel from <a href="http://makerfest.com/" target="_blank">Makerfest</a> Ahmedabad turned up, and showed us an amazing hack using Way Crayons, Sand Paper and Iron to create Iron on Transfers on T-Shirts !</p>
<p>These kids travelled all the way from Nashik to attend Make Day !</p>
<p>Our awesome friend, Amit Arora fromÂ <a title="http://www.smartprinting.co/" href="http://www.smartprinting.co/" target="_blank">http://www.smartprinting.co/</a> created a short survey on 3D Printing, and it would be interesting to see the results when he publishes them on his blog.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote><p>Â <strong>EDIT :</strong> Amit Arora has published his resultsÂ hereÂ Â :Â <a title="Inside3DP exclusive: Could India be the next 3D printing hub? Only 16% of Indians interviewed own a 3D printer" href="http://www.inside3dp.com/inside3dp-exclusive-16-indian-population-owns-3d-printer/" target="_blank">http://www.inside3dp.com/inside3dp-exclusive-16-indian-population-owns-3d-printer/</a></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>We started the movie screening at about 6:00pm after a short round of introductions, and from what I saw, it seems the audience were pretty engrossed with rapt attention watching all the magic on screen. For me, the Movie seemed special since I knew / followed a lot of the people that were interviewed.</p>
