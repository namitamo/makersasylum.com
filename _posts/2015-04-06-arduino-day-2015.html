<p>Arduino Day is a worldwide celebration of Arduino’s birthday. It's a 24 hours-long event –organized directly by the community, or by the Arduino team– where people interested in Arduino get together, share their experiences, and learn more.</p>
<p>In Mumbai we celebrated this at Makers Asylum. So we started at 11 am , with Anool taking the lead and talking about hacking and out-of-the-box ideas of how day-to-day appliances can be hacked and re-purposed. The oven can be hacked into and used for reflow soldering. Also repurposing a refrigerator into an ice-chest.</p>
<p>He narrated how Arduino was born. Arduino rose out of a formidable challenge: how to teach students to create electronics, fast. Massimo Banzi, and a group of friend came up with this prototype in 2005 and it wasn't even named Arduino. They coined the name later that year.</p>

<p>Arduino Vs. RaspPi was the debate of the hour, which one is the right DIY platform. Well the conclusion was Arduino is a micro-controller, whereas, RaspPi is a full blown computer. While Arduino is easy to learn platform and lot of resources available, Pi on the other hand need some kind of programming knowledge like Phython. Also RaspPi can multitask as your PC would, Arduino does not. Arduino is highly recommended for beginners. So as per your needs decide the the platform you need. A detailed discussion is given <a title="here" href="http://http://readwrite.com/2014/05/07/arduino-vs-raspberry-pi-projects-diy-platform" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>We were than introduced to <a title="Hackaday" href="http://hackaday.io/prize" target="_blank">Hackaday Prize</a> by Anool. Where one can submit hacks, projects, prototypes and build the future. And they aka <a title="Hackaday" href="http://hackaday.io/prize" target="_blank">Hackaday Prize</a> promise to take the Grand Prize winner of the 2015 Hackaday Prize into space. How Awesome isn't it. So, put your maker boots on and start hacking cause a simple idea can change the world. <a href="https://satnogs.org/" target="_blank">SatNOGS</a> won the Hackadaay Prize 2015.</p>
<p>Akshat than took over the discussion and told us about <a href="http://hillhacks.in/" target="_blank">Hillhacks</a>. It is all about Hacking, Art, Making, and Socialize. Putting your own spin to what is existing. And the amazing and even more amazing people and things like <a href="http://hackaday.io/project/1279-ramanpi-raman-spectrometer" target="_blank">ramanPi </a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/freaklabs" target="_blank">Akiba</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkRdWnYu1DQ" target="_blank">Wrecking Crew</a>.</p>

<p>Hemal Chevli than had a show-n-tell, showing off his projects and talking about things he make. Drawing Bot, Interactive Piano, Animal sound interactive mat, and many more under his belt. Accompanied with Ankit Daftery who took us on a brief discussion about all the existing hardware and software available for prototyping. This was just so much informative. Online alternatives  like <a href="https://www.temboo.com/" target="_blank">Temboo</a>, d<a href="http://dweet.io/" target="_blank">weet.io</a>, <a href="https://codebender.cc/" target="_blank">codebender</a>  to offline software just makes life so so easy.</p>

<p>Having spent such a #productive #informative morning, we needed some quick bites to carry ourselves for the rest of the day, and so was delicious Biryani waiting for us in the Cane basket.</p>
<p>Post lunch was the KiCAD workshop by Anool, explaining the software to get the participants started with creating of professional schematics and printed circuit boards up to 32 copper layers with additional technical layers. The software is open-source and can be downloaded <a href="http://www.kicad-pcb.org/display/KICAD/KiCad+EDA+Software+Suite" target="_blank">here</a>. Than a Arduino PCB Making workshop. The workshop was a continuation to the skills we acquired during KiCAD, hosted by Parth Temkar.</p>

<p>And last week a Thank You Certificate dropped to our mailbox.</p>
