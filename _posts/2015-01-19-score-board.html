<p>I made this scoreboard a couple of weeks ago. Just picked up a couple of wooden pieces , and leftover from acrylic sheet . It struck me when Vaibhav said letâ€™s have a score-board to track the matches we win and lose against each other . (Vaibhav and me usually end up playing TT by the end of the day. )</p>

<p>Took the material ( plywood , wood pieces , acrylic ) . Sneaked into ISDI woodworking workshop . Learnt how to use the giant woodcutting and finishing machines . Got the frame and acrylic plate cut. It took like 65 mins to complete the entire process.</p>

<p>Glued them all with fevicol . Step-by-step. Left it to dry for like a day or two .The final task was to nicely polish the entire frame with sand paper and the score-board was ready to use .</p>
