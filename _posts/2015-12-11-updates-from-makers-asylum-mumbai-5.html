<p>Last few weeks at the Asylum have been phenomenal. Workshops, events and hackathon in full throttle. The energy was overwhelming. We hosted the first of its kind hackathon called "<strong>Asylum Hack</strong>" in collaboration with Godrej.</p>
<p>It was 3 days of non-stop breaking and making consumer electronics devices.<br />
Hackathons are great learning experience for individuals and large corporations, as they pack up so much energy and knowledge in a very short amount of time.</p>
</div>
<p>"Development cycles in the real world are pretty long. And to compress that into just 2 days and to tell people that here's a problem, give me a solution in 2 days. That's pretty exciting", Anool Mahidharia, Co-founder - Maker's Asylum.</p>

<div><strong>Introduction to Git:</strong><br />
A hands on workshop to teach everyone about Git, it's advantages and it's importance in anyone's life (contrary to popular belief that it's only for IT folks).<br />
It's a great version control tool which should be used by teams irrespective of the kind of project they're working on.<br />
