Painting, electrical wiring, lighting and carpentry - it all happened in full throttle. Meera Dabir, a professionsal decorative wall painting artist, shared her expertise on wall painting and taught our community members how to paint walls. For most of the members, it was their first attempt at wall painting and the most fun thing they had done in a while. Here's a glimpse</p>

<p>Over the last couple of weeks, we got the space looking like this</p>
<p><a href="http://makersasylum.com/app/uploads/2015/10/11838749_1194980247195466_7665391326320845119_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5054" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/11838749_1194980247195466_7665391326320845119_o-700x525.jpg" alt="11838749_1194980247195466_7665391326320845119_o" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>

<p>Maker's Asylum was invited to be a part of the 3D Printing World Expo held in Nehru Center. It was a great opportunity to meet some of the leaders of the 3D printing scene in India. Young kids of Ryan International School too got a good exposure to 3D Printing technology.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, makers from around the country had gathered in Mumbai at Somaiya campus in Vidyavihar for showcasing their creation at Maker Mela. Being the 1st version of it, Maker Mela attracted a huge number of engineers and designers and other DIY hackers for their two-day long maker festival. Good to see the maker culture spreading swiftly across the country.</p>
