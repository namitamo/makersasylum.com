<p>While arcade emulators aren’t exactly unique, they’re tons of fun, and that essentially is what drove Sehaj to build one at Maker’s Asylum Delhi.</p>
<p>He says the idea popped in his head on a recent trip to Mumbai, when boredom led to a friend and him to go watch Pixels.<br />
Watching the retro-inspired imagery on screen, he decided to build an arcade emulator as soon as he got back to Delhi. Which is exactly what he did.</p>

<p>He teamed up with his friend Akshay, and showed up at the Asylum with a bag full of components.</p>

<p>The heart of the machine is of course a Raspberry Pi, running an image of RetroPie. That particular combination lends great flexibility in terms of gameplay, by allowing multiple consoles to be emulated.</p>

<p>We used the laser cutter at the Asylum to cut the plywood that was to be the housing for the electronics. I designed the case while Utkarsh pieced it together. Meanwhile Akshay and Sehaj worked on the code, and getting the Pi to behave.</p>

<p>To make it look sleek, we painted the entire thing black, and added lights inside an 8-bit cutout on top. Of course you can’t have an arcade without the buttons and controllers, so we made a trip to Chandni Chowk to procure those as well.</p>

<p>A week of tinkering and tweaking later, we have a beautiful fully-functional retro arcade, and people have been going nuts over Mario &amp; Donkey Kong (not that those are the only things you can play).</p>

<p>The total cost came to about Rs 5000 INR, which includes the Raspberry Pi, the buttons &amp; controllers, the plywood and the lights.</p>
<p>We do have plans to keep adding to this arcade. Some of the ideas we’ve discussed, include:</p>
<p>• External controller support<br />
• A phone charging station<br />
• Aux ports</p>
<p>So if you’re ever in the mood for some good old Pac-Man or Donkey Kong, drop by the Asylum, and have a go at it.</p>
