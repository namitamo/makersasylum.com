<p>So the First Build Group was announced at Makers Asylum and people from all stretch came in .  This Sunday Makers Asylum witnessed the first community meet of The Build Group .</p>
<p><strong>Cheers to the Team Drone .</strong></p>
<p>You might want to question <strong>what exactly are Build Groups</strong> ? And what will they do?</p>
<p>So Build Groups is a <strong>community initiative</strong> where the community comes together to <strong>engineer and build stuff</strong> . Helping and learning from each other . The outcome of the build groups can be taken to the next level to <strong>improvise and keep building</strong> better versions of it . Finally even end up with a <strong>product</strong> with a <strong>big market</strong> .</p>
<p><strong>Skills Required :</strong> Well you should be sound enough to know what you are doing that’s it .  You need not have all that expertise . But definitely some of what you have will benefit the group .</p>
<p>Having answered what build groups are . Lets Investigate in detail the first Build Project  - <strong>THE DRONE </strong>.</p>
<p><strong>DRONES - are unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAVs )</strong> . Usually Quadcopter , hexacopter , Octacopter depending on the number of motors they host . Usually they are powered by batteries or engines . They are either controlled by ‘pilots’ from the ground or increasingly, autonomously following a pre-programmed mission. The use of drones has grown quickly in recent years because unlike manned aircraft they can stay aloft for many hours ; they are much cheaper than military aircraft and they are flown remotely so there is no danger to the flight crew.</p>
<p><strong>Technical: </strong>The design of the frame of the drone is what matters a lot. The frame needs to be lightweight , sturdy to take accidental crashes and as minimalistic as possible . The drones use Ultrasonic sensors to avoid obstacles and maintain precise autonomous flight and to land .The gyrometer is used to measure the orientation of the drone , whereas the accelerometer measures the acceleration ( g-force ) . Control boards play a crucial role here. continuously busy analyzing the data fetched from the gyrometer and accelerometer and keeping the drone balanced. Li - Polymer Battery being dense are used to power a Drone . They last for 15 minutes and take 40 minutes to charge.</p>
<p><strong>Applications :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drone delivery , a big news by Amazon already , that INDIA will be the launch pad for this .</li>
<li>Aerial Mapping</li>
<li>Military ( spying )</li>
<li>Atmospheric Measurements</li>
<li>Communications , Facebook's Connectivity Lab is going to build drones, satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well a lot more is to be witnessed about Drones and every possible application is being examined . It’s Just begun for us and a long way to go .</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>So, excited to build one come be a part of the Build Group .  </strong></p>
<p>Drop a mail to : <strong>rupin.chheda@gmail.com</strong></p>
<p>Group Lead : <strong>Rupin Chedda</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stay tuned to Makers Asylum for more build groups to be announced in the coming month . </strong></p>
